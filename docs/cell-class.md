# Cell Class

Lets authors apply one or more CSS classes to a block cell `div` by placing a `[classname]` (or `[classname-1,classname-2]`) code snippet as the first element of that cell. The snippet is consumed during decoration and does not appear in the rendered page.

This is a separate system from the span-tags `[[double-bracket]]` syntax. Single brackets formatted as **inline code** via the DA toolbar target the parent cell div; double brackets authored as plain text target inline text spans within a paragraph or heading.

## 1. Authoring

### 1.1 Syntax

In DA, type the class name wrapped in square brackets as the very first line of the cell — before any other content. Then select the full text including the brackets and click the **Toggle inline code** (`<>`) button in the DA toolbar:

1. Type `[color-primary]` as the first line of the cell
2. Select the full text `[color-primary]`
3. Click the **`<>`** (Toggle inline code) button in the DA toolbar

Place it before any other content in the cell. The `[color-primary]` line is removed during decoration. The rendered result is:

```html
<div class="color-primary">
  <p>Symptoms are typically first seen in the first week of treatment.</p>
</div>
```

### 1.2 Multiple classes

Separate class names with a comma (no spaces) to apply more than one class to the same cell:

1. Type `[width-50,bg-grey]` as the first line of the cell
2. Select the full text `[width-50,bg-grey]`
3. Click the **`<>`** (Toggle inline code) button in the DA toolbar

```html
<div class="width-50 bg-grey">
  <p>Symptoms are typically first seen in the first week of treatment.</p>
</div>
```

### 1.3 Width utility classes

`width-75`, `width-66`, `width-50`, `width-33`, and `width-25` set a cell's width to that approximate percentage (defined in `styles/styles.css`). Apply one to an individual column cell to size it within its row, or combine it with another class using the comma syntax above:

```
[width-33]
[width-66,color-secondary]
```

### 1.4 Position requirement

The code snippet must be the **first element** in the cell. A code snippet elsewhere in the cell is not matched and the cell is left unchanged.

✅ First line of the cell — matched and removed: the inline code `[color-primary]` appears before any other content in the cell.

❌ Not the first element — ignored: any other content appears before the inline code `[color-primary]`.

### 1.5 Class name rules

Only letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, and commas (as a separator between multiple class names) are accepted. Invalid names are silently ignored and the cell is left unchanged.

✅ `[color-primary]` — letters and hyphens  
✅ `[hide-mobile]` — letters and hyphens  
✅ `[stats_callout]` — underscore allowed  
✅ `[width-50,bg-grey]` — comma-separated, multiple classes  
❌ `[color primary]` — space not allowed  
❌ `[color@primary]` — special character not allowed  
❌ `[width-50, bg-grey]` — space after comma not allowed  
❌ `[]` — empty name not matched

## 2. Developer

### 2.1 Where the code lives

`decorateCellClass(block)` is exported from `scripts/utils.js`.

### 2.2 How it works

The function iterates every cell `div` (each direct child of each row) inside the block. For each cell it checks whether:

1. The first element child is a `<p>`
2. That `<p>` contains exactly one child element, and it is a `<code>`
3. The `<code>` text content matches `/^\[([a-zA-Z0-9_,-]+)\]$/`

When all three conditions are met, the matched text is split on commas and each resulting class name is added to the cell `div`; the `<p>` is removed. Cells that do not match are left completely unchanged.

### 2.3 How to use it in a block

Import from `scripts/utils.js` and call it as the first line of `decorate(block)`, before any other DOM manipulation:

```javascript
import { decorateCellClass } from '../../scripts/utils.js';

export default function decorate(block) {
  decorateCellClass(block);

  // existing decoration logic follows unchanged...
}
```

Reference implementation: `blocks/columns/columns.js`.

### 2.4 Compatibility

`decorateCellClass` works with any block that uses the standard EDS cell structure:

```
.block
  └── div  (row)
        └── div  (cell)  ← class is added here
              ├── p > code  ← consumed and removed
              └── ...remaining cell content unchanged
```

It makes no assumptions about the number of rows or columns, and is safe to call on blocks with no matching cells.
